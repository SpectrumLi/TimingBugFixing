3.Manual Patch.
	https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12473717/HBASE-3596.patch

4.Input for DFix.
	./input directory
	./input/config : bug report.
	./input/jarpath : app jar files location.
	./input/srcpath	: app source code location.
	
5.DFix Patch.
	./patch directory. see the detail.patch file.

6.Discussion.
	The manual patch add a random sleep before the HLog taking over, which does not fix the bug at all. DFix cleans the taken HLog so that other node can start it from scratch.
