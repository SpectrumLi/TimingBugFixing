1.Bug Reproduce.
	start 3 cassandra processes at the same time.

2.Original Bug Report.
	This is an atomicity violation. 2 replica servers would join the cluster with the same key.
	https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-1011

3.Manual Patch.
	No patch.

4.Input for DFix.
	The bug description : DFix/benchmark/ca-1011/config.
	The casuality chains : DFix/benchmark/ca-1011/css and DFix/benchmark/ca-1011/signalcss.
	
5.DFix Patch.
	DFix/software/ca-1011/details

6.Discussion.
	The developers decide to change the key-generation algorithm so that two replica nodes never get the same token.
	DFix fixes the bug by delaying the later replica node to join until the previous node finishes the join.
