3.Manual Patch.
	https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12473717/HBASE-3596.patch

5.DFix Patch.
	FFix/software/hb-3596-rollback/details.patch

6.Discussion.
	The manual patch add a random sleep before the HLog taking over, which does not fix the bug at all. DFix cleans the taken HLog so that other node can start it from scratch.
