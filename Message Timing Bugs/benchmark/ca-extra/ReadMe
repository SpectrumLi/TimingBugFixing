1.Bug Reproduce.
	start 3 cassandra processes at the same time.

2.Original Bug Report.
	This is an atomicity violation. 2 replica servers would join the cluster with the same key.
	https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-1011

3.Manual Patch.
	./patch/Manual.patch. If no manual patch, this file would be empty.

4.Input for DFix.
	./input directory.
	./input/config : the bug report.
	./input/css : the causality stack of wait operation.
	./input/signalcss : the causality stack of signal operation.
	./input/jarscope : application jar file locations.
	

5.Temporary files.
	./temp directory. The intermediate files for patch generation.
	
6.DFix Patch.
	./patch/DFix.patch.


7.Discussion.
	The developers decide to change the key-generation algorithm so that two replica nodes never get the same token.
	DFix fixes the bug by delaying the later replica node to join until the previous node finishes the join.
